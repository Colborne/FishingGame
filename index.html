Monetization permission for any user
I, Logan Colborne
give my explicit and legal permission to
any user of your video broadcasting service,
to monetize videos of Logan Colborne-made games including but not limited to or any other title, prototype or terrible game jam thing developed by in the past, current or future, on any channel owned by said user.
</p?
		<p>This permission is (retro-actively) valid from the moment your service has been launched until the end of time / apocalypse. This permission shall not be limited to any territory, planet, solar system, universe or hypothetical alternate realities.
Seriously, any user is allowed to monetize videos using our games for commercial goals. It is good for us too when people share their opinion about our games, you know. Free marketing and all that, but also a good way for us to lift our moods when we're a bit demotivated - watching videos of people playing our games is really energizing for us. We would recommend it to engineers and designers over at your place.
Either way, if somebody can earn a penny or get filthy rich doing that, we are totally cool with that.
